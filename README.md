# Network Security Fundamentals

## Overview
This project is a Python-based learning lab designed to introduce fundamental networking and cybersecurity concepts through hands-on practice.

The focus is on understanding how data is transmitted over a network, how insecure communication can be abused, and how basic defensive monitoring can be implemented ethically.

---

## Learning Objectives
- Understand client–server communication
- Learn basic TCP networking concepts
- Observe and log network activity
- Identify suspicious connection patterns
- Apply cybersecurity ethics and responsibility

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Sockets (TCP)
- Logging
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

---

## Project Scope & Ethics
This project is developed strictly for educational purposes.
All traffic analysis and attack simulations are performed in a controlled local environment.
No real-world systems or networks are targeted.
