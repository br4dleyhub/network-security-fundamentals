# Network Security Fundamentals

## Overview
This project is a Python-based learning lab designed to introduce fundamental networking and cybersecurity concepts through hands-on practice.

The focus is on understanding how data is transmitted over a network, how insecure communication can be abused, and how basic defensive monitoring can be implemented ethically.
